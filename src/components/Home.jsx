                        Service-based companies are the ones that do not have a particular product but their primary business is to provide services. If we talk more clearly then they work for other organizations or have client-based products. The services they provide are intangible and can be provided in the terms of expertise, amenities, or skills. These companies generally provide less salary compared to product-based companies. Some of the popular service-based companies are TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, etc.
